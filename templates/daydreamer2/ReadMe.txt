*** Utilizing Menus
-------------------------------
1. Go to Joomla Administrator (www.your-site.com/administrator) -> Extensions -> Module Manager.
2. Open an existing menu or create a new one and place it into the "user3" position.

NOTE: the "user3" position can contain only a single menu, or none.

*** Customizing the Footer
------------------------------
To customize the template footer in Joomla administration place one or multiple modules into
the "copyright" position. This will replace the default copyright text included in the template
footer with the new content provided by the module.

Here are sample steps to configure custom footer:
1. Go to Joomla Administrator (www.your-site.com/administrator) -> Extensions -> Module Manager.
2. Click "New", select "Custom HTML", then select "Next".
3. In the module properties specify:
    Title - Show Title: No
    Position: copyright
    Custom Output: (the desired footer content)
4. Save your changes.

You can now use the newly created module for further footer customizations without utilizing additional modules.
